### ❌ Missing Items (TODO)

#### High Priority - Core Educational Materials
- [ ] **Exercises for Chapters 11-15**
  - Chapter 11: Causal Inference in Time Series
  - Chapter 12: Time Series Forecasting
  - Chapter 13: Applications and Case Studies
  - Chapter 14: Computational Efficiency and Practical Considerations
  - Chapter 15: Future Directions and Open Problems

- [ ] **Worked Examples for Chapters 11-15**
  - Same chapters as above
  - Should demonstrate practical application of concepts

#### Medium Priority - Promised Features
- [ ] **"Philosophical Interludes" throughout book**
  - Currently only exists in Chapter 2
  - Preface promises these would be "interspersed throughout"
  - Should add to remaining chapters where appropriate

- [ного **"Computational Challenges" sections**
  - Mentioned in Preface but not found in any chapters
  - Should provide practical implementation exercises
  - Could be added to each chapter or as separate sections

#### Low Priority - Enhancements
- [ ] Review consistency of writing style across all chapters
- [ ] Add cross-references between related chapters
- [ ] Ensure all code examples are complete and tested
- [ ] Add index/glossary if desired

#### Low Priority - Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] **Restructure dependency graph for chapter-level context loading**
  - Current graph has overly long sequential chains (especially Ch 13→14→15)
  - Many missing cross-topic dependencies (e.g., ML chapters need stationarity concepts)
  - Should be topic-based rather than sequential
  - Goal: Keep dependency chains under 40,000 tokens for efficient LLM context usage
  - Remove fine-grained section-to-section dependencies within chapters

### Notes

1. **Book Attribution**: Written in the style of famous scientists:
   - Richard Feynman
   - Andrew Gelman  
   - E. T. Jaynes
   - Kevin Murphy

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - Main content: `/Time Series Book v2 (Claude)/`
   - Part 1 sources: `/Time Series Book v2 (Claude) Part 1/`
   - Part 2 sources: `/Time Series Book v2 (Clause) Part 2/` (note typo in "Clause")

3. **Next Steps**: 
   - Priority should be creating exercises and worked examples for chapters 11-15
   - Then add the missing philosophical interludes and computational challenges
   - Finally, general cleanup and consistency check
