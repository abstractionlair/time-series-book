Here are the worked examples for Chapter 10, designed to bridge the gap between the main text and the exercises. These examples aim to provide a detailed walkthrough of the key concepts and methods introduced in the chapter, preparing students to tackle the exercises effectively.

### Worked Example 1: Understanding Long Memory Processes
**Context:** Before diving into Exercise 1 on long memory processes and fractional differencing, it’s essential to grasp the concept of long memory and how it manifests in time series data.

1. **Theoretical Background:**
   - Long memory processes are characterized by a slow decay of the autocorrelation function (ACF), which implies that observations far apart in time are still correlated. This contrasts with short memory processes, where the ACF decays rapidly.
   - The Hurst exponent (\(H\)) is a measure of long memory, with \(H > 0.5\) indicating long memory and \(H = 0.5\) corresponding to a random walk.

2. **Example:**
   - Consider a time series generated by an ARFIMA(0, d, 0) model, where \(d = 0.3\). This model introduces long memory by allowing for fractional differencing.
   - **Step 1:** Simulate the ARFIMA series in R or Python using appropriate libraries.
     ```python
     import numpy as np
     import statsmodels.tsa.arima_process as ap
     arparams = np.array([1])
     maparams = np.array([1])
     d = 0.3
     simulated_data = ap.arma_generate_sample(ar=arparams, ma=maparams, d=d, nsample=1000)
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Plot the ACF of the simulated data to observe the slow decay.
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf
     plot_acf(simulated_data)
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Discuss the implications of the slow decay on the predictability and behavior of the time series.

3. **Connection to Exercise 1:**
   - This example prepares you to simulate and analyze long memory processes, directly linking to the tasks in Exercise 1, where you'll explore different values of \(d\) and apply fractional differencing.

### Worked Example 2: Time Series on Networks
**Context:** Exercise 2 introduces time series indexed by networks, requiring an understanding of how to handle data that varies over both time and space.

1. **Theoretical Background:**
   - Time series on networks involve observations not only across time but also across nodes in a network (e.g., geographical locations). Spatial-temporal models are often used to capture the dependencies between nodes over time.

2. **Example:**
   - Consider a dataset of daily temperatures recorded across a network of weather stations.
   - **Step 1:** Visualize the network and the time series data using network plots.
     ```python
     import networkx as nx
     G = nx.Graph()
     G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)])
     pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
     nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True)
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Fit a spatial-temporal model, such as a Gaussian Process with a kernel combining time and spatial components.
     ```python
     from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
     from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF, ConstantKernel as C
     # Assuming 'data' is structured with spatial coordinates and time
     kernel = C(1.0) * RBF(length_scale=1.0)
     gp = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel)
     gp.fit(X_train, y_train)
     y_pred, sigma = gp.predict(X_test, return_std=True)
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Evaluate the model’s performance in capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies.

3. **Connection to Exercise 2:**
   - This worked example helps you become familiar with the process of visualizing and modeling time series on networks, which is critical for tackling Exercise 2’s tasks involving spatial-temporal models.

### Worked Example 3: Dimensionality Reduction in Multivariate Time Series
**Context:** In Exercise 3, you’ll work with high-dimensional time series data. This example demonstrates how to apply dimensionality reduction techniques before model fitting.

1. **Theoretical Background:**
   - High-dimensional time series can be challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce dimensionality by transforming the original data into a set of uncorrelated components.

2. **Example:**
   - Consider a dataset of daily returns for a portfolio of 50 stocks.
   - **Step 1:** Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
     ```python
     from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
     pca = PCA(n_components=5)
     principal_components = pca.fit_transform(stock_returns)
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Plot the variance explained by each principal component to decide on the number of components to retain.
     ```python
     plt.plot(np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_))
     plt.xlabel('Number of Components')
     plt.ylabel('Variance Explained')
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Use the reduced dataset to fit a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and compare it with a model fitted on the full dataset.

3. **Connection to Exercise 3:**
   - This example provides hands-on experience with PCA, directly applicable to Exercise 3, where you’ll be reducing the dimensionality of multivariate time series data and assessing the impact on model performance.

### Worked Example 4: Functional Time Series Analysis
**Context:** Exercise 4 deals with functional time series, where each observation is a function or curve. This example introduces the concept and demonstrates basic functional data analysis.

1. **Theoretical Background:**
   - Functional time series consist of data where each observation is a curve or function, such as a daily temperature curve. Functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) is commonly used for dimensionality reduction in this context.

2. **Example:**
   - Consider a dataset where daily intraday stock prices are treated as functions over time.
   - **Step 1:** Convert the dataset into a functional data object.
     ```python
     import numpy as np
     from fdasrsf import fdasrsf
     # Assuming data is structured appropriately
     fdata = fdasrsf.FDataGrid(data_matrix=stock_prices)
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Perform fPCA on the functional data.
     ```python
     fpca = fdata.fpca(n_components=3)
     fpca.plot()
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Interpret the functional principal components and their contribution to the overall variability in the data.

3. **Connection to Exercise 4:**
   - This example equips you with the necessary tools to tackle Exercise 4, where you’ll analyze functional time series data using similar techniques and models.

### Worked Example 5: Modeling Point Processes
**Context:** Exercise 5 requires understanding and modeling point processes, which are suitable for events occurring irregularly over time.

1. **Theoretical Background:**
   - Point processes model the occurrence of events at irregular intervals. The Poisson process is a fundamental model in this category, with extensions like the Hawkes process to handle self-exciting phenomena.

2. **Example:**
   - Consider modeling the occurrence of transactions in a financial market.
   - **Step 1:** Simulate a simple Poisson process to model event times.
     ```python
     import numpy as np
     event_times = np.cumsum(np.random.exponential(scale=1.0, size=100))
     plt.plot(event_times, np.arange(1, len(event_times) + 1), marker='o')
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Fit a Poisson process model to a dataset of timestamped events.
     ```python
     from tick.hawkes import SimuPoissonProcess
     pp = SimuPoissonProcess(intensity=0.1, end_time=100)
     pp.simulate()
     pp.plot()
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Extend the model to a Hawkes process and discuss the differences in the event clustering behavior.

3. **Connection to Exercise 5:**
   - This worked example introduces you to the basic modeling techniques for point processes, laying the groundwork for more complex tasks in Exercise 5, such as fitting inhomogeneous processes and comparing different models.

### Worked Example 6: Bayesian Nonparametric Time Series Modeling
**Context:** Exercise 6 explores Bayesian nonparametric methods. This example introduces Gaussian Processes, a fundamental tool in this domain.

1. **Theoretical Background:**
   - Bayesian nonparametric models like Gaussian Processes (GPs) offer flexibility by allowing the model complexity to grow with the data. GPs are particularly useful for modeling non-linear time series without specifying a fixed parametric form.

2. **Example:**
   - Consider a dataset of monthly average temperatures. We’ll use a GP to model and predict future temperatures.
   - **Step 1:** Define the GP with an appropriate kernel (e.g., RBF kernel for smooth functions).
     ```python
     from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
     from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import RBF, ConstantKernel as C
     kernel = C(1.0) * RBF(length_scale=10.0)
     gp = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel, n_restarts_optimizer=10)
     gp.fit(X_train,

 y_train)
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Use the GP to make predictions and visualize the results.
     ```python
     y_pred, sigma = gp.predict(X_test, return_std=True)
     plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, 'b-', label='Prediction')
     plt.fill_between(X_test[:, 0], y_pred - 1.96*sigma, y_pred + 1.96*sigma, alpha=0.2, color='k')
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Discuss the advantages of using a GP, such as flexibility and uncertainty quantification.

3. **Connection to Exercise 6:**
   - This example introduces the core concepts of Bayesian nonparametrics, preparing you to apply these methods in Exercise 6, where you’ll explore different nonparametric models and their applications to time series data.

These worked examples are designed to provide a smooth transition from the theory covered in the main text to the practical challenges presented in the exercises. They ensure that students are well-prepared to engage with the exercises and reinforce their understanding of advanced time series analysis techniques.
